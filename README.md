# jgerman/advent_of_code_2022

Advent of code 2022. As usualy not going for speed, golfing, etc, just trying to
write clean code and solve the problems.

## Day 1

Obviously a nice easy slow start. Initially I went with max on the list of the
sum of the elves calories... I should have anticipated that I'd want them sorted
so I could grab a set of them. Quick and easy change.

## Day 2

I thought I was being slick by just turning the strategy guide into something
readable then basing my answer off of that, great for task 1, but iffy for task
2.

This could be solved more elegantly by passing how to handle the second column
of the guide in to be used at the last minute instead of where I'm currently
passing it, but I wanted to wrap up before my lunch break was over. One to
revisit and refactor to be clean.
